### ü¶Ä  Oxidation ü¶Ä

Oxidation is a list of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)-based command-line, TUI, and GUI tools. This list started out 
as a way to track oxidized recreations of [coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/) utilities. It quickly 
grew to include any Rust-based CLI, TUI, and GUI apps and utilities that I happened to run across. Note: while the apps
listed here can be used as core system utilities, most of them are not 100% drop-in replacements. That being said, you 
will find that these Rust-based equivalent tools typically implement **most** of the same functionality found in their 
`coreutils` brethren, offer additional, modern features, and are often faster overall. I'm sure that I missed plenty of  
of awesome oxidized utilities when I first compiled this list. Please feel free to contact me with anything that you feel 
should be added, or issue a pull request and I'll get to it as soon as I can. Thanks!

### ü¶Ä Core Utilities

Rust-based replacements for `coreutils` system commands. You can easily use all of these tools as replacements for your
current system tools/commands. The easiest way to implement this change is via aliases. Not sure where to start? Take a 
look at the documentation for your particular shell and how it handles aliases.
