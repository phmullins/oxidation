### Oxidation ðŸ¦€

Oxidation is a list of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)-based command-line tools that are oxidized recreations of 
[coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/) programs. Please note that these are not 100% drop-in replacements. 
However, that being said, the tools listed here do typically implement most of the same functionality found in their 
coreutils brethren, and in many cases offer additional modern features and superior speed. I'm fairly sure I missed 
more than a few awesome Rusty utilities when I compiled this list. Please feel free to contact me with anything that 
you feel should be added, or issue a pull request and I'll get to it as soon as I can. Thanks!

### Oxidized Core Utilities

Rusty replacements for `coreutils` system commands. You can easily use all of these tools by themselves or as replacements 
for current system tools/commands. The easiest way to use them as replacements is by creating aliases.
