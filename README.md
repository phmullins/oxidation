# Oxidation
Oxidation is a list of Rust-based command-line tools that are oxidized recreations of coreutils programs. Please note that these are not 100% drop-in replacements.
However, that being said, the tools listed here do typically implement most of the same functionality found in their coreutils brethren, and in many cases offer additional modern features and superior speed.

The [Oxidation](https://gitlab.com/phmullins/oxidation) repo now lives on GitLab.
